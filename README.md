## About

The Quiz-game comprises multiple-choice questions, with the user presented with another question when they answer the previous one. However, if the user answers a question incorrectly, time is subtracted from the clock, adding an element of difficulty to the game.

The quiz ends when either all the questions are answered, or the timer reaches zero. At the end of the game, the user has the option to save their initials and score to track their progress over time.
